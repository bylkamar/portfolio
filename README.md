## 🔄 The Evolution: V1 to V2

This version represents a complete architectural and visual overhaul. I transitioned from a traditional blue-themed layout to a **dark-centric, UX-optimized experience** to improve readability and visual impact.

### Comparison
* **Design:** From "Classic Blue" to a **Refined Dark Theme** for better eye comfort.
* **Motion:** From static CSS to **Complex Orchestration** with Framer Motion.
